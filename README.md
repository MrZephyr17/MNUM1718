# MNUM1718

Collection of methods written in C++. If you want to test them, just download them and adapt them to your data.

# Usage

These methods are written so that you can easily download and test them, by quickly changing values or adding functions.
Note that, at least when I took the course, the UC's exams where heavily practical, in the sense that most exercises requiered the student to write a method and answer with the results. At most two questions per exam required theoretical knowledge.
So, here's some advice:

- You don't need to memorize most of these methods, since the UC's textbook is available during the exams and it has the general algorithms. However, some chapters have errors (Optimization for example) so be careful.

- However some of the methods are not, to my experience, well explained in the book so I'd advise you to memorize Gauss and dif_systems methods.

- Maxima and excel are also available, but use programming whenever you can, since you will be rewarded. For example, because of this my final grade went up 3 (!) points.
